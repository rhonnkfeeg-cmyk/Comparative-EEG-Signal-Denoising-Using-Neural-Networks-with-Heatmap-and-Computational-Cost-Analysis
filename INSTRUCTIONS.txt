INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE EXPERIMENTS

This document describes how to execute all experiments included in this repository.
The execution strictly follows the experimental protocol presented in the associated article.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE EXECUTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Before running any experiment, carefully read the file:

   REQUIREMENTS.txt

This file specifies all required software, programming languages, libraries,
CUDA configuration, and hardware dependencies needed to run the experiments.

Ensure that:
- Python and MATLAB are installed in the specified versions.
- All required Python libraries are correctly installed.
- CUDA and GPU drivers are properly configured (if GPU execution is used).

Failure to meet these requirements may result in execution errors.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
DOWNLOADING AND EXTRACTING MULTI-PART ZIP FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to file size limitations, some folders in this repository are provided
as multi-part compressed files (e.g., .zip split into several parts).

Follow the instructions below to correctly reconstruct the original folders:

1. Download ALL parts of the compressed file.
   Example:
      dataset_part1.zip
      dataset_part2.zip
      dataset_part3.zip
      dataset_part4.zip
      dataset_part5.zip
      dataset_part6.zip
      dataset_part7.zip
      dataset_part8.zip
      dataset_part9.zip
      dataset_part10.zip
      dataset_part11.zip
      dataset_part12.zip
      dataset_part13.zip
      dataset_part14.zip
      dataset_part15.zip
      dataset_part16.zip
      dataset_part17.zip

2. Place ALL downloaded parts in the SAME directory.

3. Do NOT rename any of the zip files.

4. Extract ONLY the first part of the archive.
   For example:
      Right-click on: dataset_part1.zip
      Select: Extract here

5. The extraction process will automatically detect and use the remaining
   parts to reconstruct the complete folder.

6. After extraction, verify that the resulting folder structure matches
   the repository structure described in the README.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Extracting only one part is sufficient; do NOT extract each part separately.
- Ensure enough disk space before extraction.
- Use standard extraction tools such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or unzip (Linux).

GENERAL INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Do NOT rename folders or files.
- Do NOT change the directory structure.
- All scripts rely on fixed relative paths.
- Results are automatically stored in the corresponding "results" folders.
- Python must be installed and properly configured before execution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST A: PRETRAINED MODEL EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Test A evaluates the denoising performance of pretrained neural network models.
No additional training is performed in this stage.

STEP A1: Navigate to the Test A directory

   Files/Test_A/PRETRAINED_TEST/TEST/

STEP A2: Run pretrained model inference

Execute the following script:

   python P1_Run_EEG_Models_all_tests.py

This script performs the following tasks:
- Loads pretrained models from TRAINING/MODELS/
- Processes all subjects (Sujeto_1 to Sujeto_54)
- Applies EEG denoising independently for each channel
- Stores intermediate outputs

STEP A3: Compute metrics and generate heatmaps

After Step A2 finishes, execute:

   python P2_Run_EEG_Models_results_and_heatmaps.py

This script:
- Computes denoising performance metrics
- Generates channel-wise EEG heatmaps
- Stores numerical results and figures in the "results" folder

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST B: K-FOLD TRAINING AND EVALUATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Test B evaluates the models using a 5-Fold cross-validation strategy (K1–K5).
Each fold is executed independently.

STEP B1: Select a fold (example: K1)

Navigate to:

   Files/Test_B/K1/TEST/

STEP B2: Run training and testing

Execute:

   python P1_Run_EEG_Models_all_tests.py

This script:
- Loads training data from TRAINING/
- Trains neural network models for the selected fold
- Tests the models using unseen subjects
- Saves trained models and predictions

STEP B3: Compute metrics and generate heatmaps

After Step B2 finishes, execute:

   python P2_Run_EEG_Models_results_and_heatmaps.py

Results are saved in:

   Files/Test_B/K1/TEST/results/

STEP B4: Repeat for all folds

Repeat STEPS B1 to B3 for the following folds:

   Files/Test_B/K2/
   Files/Test_B/K3/
   Files/Test_B/K4/
   Files/Test_B/K5/

Final performance metrics are obtained by averaging results across all folds.
